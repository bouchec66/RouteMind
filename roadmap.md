## 🧠 RouteMind – 2-Year Product Roadmap

### Year 1: Foundation & Pilot Deployments

#### Q2 (Apr–Jun)
- ✅ Finalize core architecture (model routing logic, inference pipelines)
- ✅ Set up RunPod infrastructure & automated deployment workflows
- 🔄 Implement basic chaining interface (e.g., YAML/JSON-based routing instructions)
- 🔄 Internal CLI/GUI prototype for configuring chains
- 🔄 Begin documentation & branding refinement

#### Q3 (Jul–Sep)
- 🧪 Launch MVP with simple rule-based routing
- 📊 Build usage logging & performance analytics dashboard
- 🔌 Add support for major open-source models (Mistral, LLaMA, Gemma)
- ⚙️ Develop testing suite for routing optimization and model fallback behavior
- 👥 Identify 1–2 pilot users (e.g., indie developers, researchers)

#### Q4 (Oct–Dec)
- 🚀 Launch public beta
- 🪄 Add a feedback-learning routing layer (log + reweight based on feedback)
- 🌐 Web UI for configuring and visualizing model flows
- 📦 Add plugin support for file input (PDFs, CSVs, code, etc.)
- 🛡 Basic access control & API key system

### Year 2: Growth, Intelligence & Scale

#### Q1 (Jan–Mar)
- 🧠 Integrate routing based on task classification using a lightweight LLM
- 🗃 Add project/workspace-level versioning
- ⚡ Add support for energy-aware routing (optimize latency/cost vs. energy use)
- 💬 Multi-modal (image + text) routing prototype
- 📣 Developer outreach: technical talks, Substack/LinkedIn series

#### Q2 (Apr–Jun)
- 🧪 Launch intelligent routing v1 (fine-tuned classifier or meta-model)
- 🔧 Add billing + usage dashboards
- 🔄 User-contributed routing templates / marketplace
- 📱 Mobile-friendly front-end for light inference tasks
- 🔐 Enterprise-ready auth (SSO, audit logs)

#### Q3 (Jul–Sep)
- 🔁 Fine-tuning feedback loops (e.g., reward routing decisions based on performance)
- 🔗 Expand integrations (Zapier, Notion, Slack, etc.)
- 🛠 SDKs for Python and Node
- 📦 Expand RunPod deployment to allow autoscaling and user-specified GPU profiles
- 🔍 Route tracing and explainer tools

#### Q4 (Oct–Dec)
- 🎯 Production-ready release v1.0
- 🧠 Dynamic multi-model reasoning (e.g., agent chains + retrieval)
- 🧩 Plug-in support for external tools (code execution, RAG backends)
- 📈 Open-source SDK & routing recipes
- 🤝 Strategic partnerships or open call for LLM hosting providers
